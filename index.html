        <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="profile picture">
          <p>I have been working in Software Quality Assurance & Enginering field for the past 13 years. I came to USA in 2007 from India. I am currently working as a Sr. QA Lead.</p>
          <p>Software Testing has been drastically changed for the past couple of years due to DevOps, Continuos Integration, Test Driven Development (TDD), Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) etc. Most of the comapnies were using only couple of Automated Test Tools (e.g. HP QuickTest Professional/Unified Functional Testing) until 1 or 2 years ago and sotware testers were able to manage automated testing with very minmal or no coding skills. However, there are so many open source automation tools available in the market (e.g. Selenium) and software testers are now expected to have strong coding/application development skils as well.</p>
          <p>My goal from the program is learn coding so that I can switch my career to Software/Application Development in case of any suitable opportunities.</p>
          <p>I live in Alpharetta, GA with my wife. I enjoy watching movies.</p>
